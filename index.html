			Firefly is an asynchronous web framework which bases on the intuitive design that enables <strong>QUICK and EASY</strong> development of network applications, such as website, protocol servers, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			Firefly is incredibly flexible - whether it's simple network utilities, sophisticated modern web applications, HTTP/REST microservices.
			Firefly is not a restrictive framework or container, and we don't tell you a correct way to write an application.
			Instead, we give you a lot of useful bricks and let you create your app the way you want to.
			Need some guidance? We provide a large selection of <a href="{{ site.url }}/docs/http-server-and-client.html">examples</a> to get you started for the particular type of application you want to write.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you already worked with some web applications, such as spring framework, you will feel right at home.
			Firefly uses some same concepts and naming schemes.
			Even if you’re from a different background, you’ll get the hang of it quickly, because everything is designed to be an intuitive and easy to use as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
			Quick and easy doesn't mean it has the performance issue or it's not maintainable.
			Firefly exposes the hardware’s full potential and uses some technologies of state of the art to achieve high throughput.
			In short: <strong>It’s FAST</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Enjoy being a developer again. Unlike restrictive traditional application containers.
			Firefly gives you incredible power and agility to create compelling, scalable, 21st-century applications the way you want to.
