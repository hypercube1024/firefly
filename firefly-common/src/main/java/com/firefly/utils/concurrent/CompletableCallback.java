/**
 * <p>
 * A callback to be used by driver code that needs to know whether the callback
 * has been succeeded or failed (that is, completed) just after the asynchronous
 * operation or not, typically because further processing depends on the
 * callback being completed. The driver code competes with the asynchronous
 * operation to complete the callback.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the callback is already completed, the driver code continues the
 * processing, otherwise it suspends it. If it is suspended, the callback will
 * be completed some time later, and {@link #resume()} or
 * {@link #abort(Throwable)} will be called to allow the application to resume
 * the processing.
 * </p>
 * Typical usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * CompletableCallback callback = new CompletableCallback()
 * {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void resume()
 *     {
 *         // continue processing
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void abort(Throwable failure)
 *     {
 *         // abort processing
 *     }
 * }
 * asyncOperation(callback);
 * boolean completed = callback.tryComplete();
 * if (completed)
 *     // suspend processing, async operation not done yet
 * else
 *     // continue processing, async operation already done
 * </pre>
