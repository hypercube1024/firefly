/**
 * UTF-8 StringBuilder.
 * <p>
 * This class wraps a standard {@link java.lang.StringBuilder} and provides
 * methods to append UTF-8 encoded bytes, that are converted into characters.
 * <p>
 * This class is stateful and up to 4 calls to {@link #append(byte)} may be
 * needed before state a character is appended to the string buffer.
 * <p>
 * The UTF-8 decoding is done by this class and no additional buffers or Readers
 * are used. The UTF-8 code was inspired by
 * http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa/
